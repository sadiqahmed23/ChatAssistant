### Chat Assistant for SQLite Database
Overview
This is a Python-based chat assistant that interacts with an SQLite database to answer user queries in natural language. The assistant converts user queries into SQL commands, fetches data from the database, and provides clear, formatted responses.

The project is designed to evaluate the ability to design, implement, and deploy a functional chat assistant that works seamlessly with an SQLite database.
